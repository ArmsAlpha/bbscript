# BBScript

## What does this tool do?
This program is made to allow anyone to parse BBScript into a readable (and modifiable) format. It functions through game databases in [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format, allowing it to be extended to work with any ArcSys game using BBScript regardless of the differences in functions and their corresponding values.

## What is BBScript?
BBScript is a script format used by Arc System Works to define functions in their games such as character moves. It's used in most modern ArcSys games such as Blazblue CentralFiction, Guilty Gear Xrd, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Granblue Fantasy Versus.
